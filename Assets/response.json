{"response_text": "It's common for the squat to be stronger than the deadlift, especially for beginners. Here are some things you can focus on to improve your deadlift:\n\n**Technique:**\n\n* **Grip:** Make sure you're using a mixed grip (one hand overhand, one hand underhand) to prevent the bar from rolling. This is crucial for stability.\n* **Starting Position:** Keep your shins as close to the bar as possible, with your feet hip-width apart. Your back should be straight and your core tight.\n* **Pull:** Focus on driving your hips forward and keeping your back straight throughout the lift. Imagine pulling the bar up your legs, not just lifting it off the ground.\n* **Lockout:** Once the bar is past your knees, stand up completely and lock out your hips and knees.\n\n**Strength:**\n\n* **Lower Back:** Include exercises like good mornings, hyperextension, and dead bug to strengthen your lower back.\n* **Hamstrings:**  Exercises like hamstring curls, RDLs, and glute-ham raises will build strength in your hamstrings, which are crucial for deadlifting.\n* **Grip Strength:** Practice deadlifts with a fat grip bar or use grippers to improve grip strength.\n\n**Other Factors:**\n\n* **Warm-up:** A proper warm-up including mobility drills, light cardio, and dynamic stretches is essential for preparing your body for the lift.\n* **Progressive Overload:** Gradually increase the weight you lift over time. This could be through adding weight to the bar, increasing the number of reps, or shortening the rest periods.\n* **Rest and Nutrition:** Getting enough sleep and eating a healthy diet will help your body recover from training and build muscle.\n\n**Important Note:** **Consult with a qualified powerlifting coach or personal trainer** to get personalized advice and technique feedback. They can help you identify any issues in your form and create a training program specifically for your needs. \n"}
